MediManager — Medical Store Inventory Manager

A small Java console application that manage a medical store's inventory.

**Overview**
- **Purpose:** It is a simple inventory manager to store medicines, view stock, and save/load from a plain-text database file.
- **Language:** Java (compatible with Java 8+).

**Features**
- **Add / Remove Medicines:** Used to maintain products with name, ID, price and quantity.
- **List Inventory:** Print current stock to console.
- **Expiry Tracking:** Scan and warn about near-expiry medicines.
- **Persistent Storage:** Uses `pharmacy_db.txt` to persist inventory between runs.

**Repository Files**
- `MediManagerAppBackend.java`: Core inventory logic and file I/O.
- `MedicineInput.java`: Model class representing a medicine item.
- `MediManagerApp.java`: Application entry point (contains `main`).
- `pharmacy_db.txt`: Plain-text database used by the app to persist inventory.
- `images`: Supporting images

**Requirements**
- Java JDK 8 or newer installed and available on `PATH`.

**Build & Run (Windows PowerShell)**
- Open PowerShell and change into the project folder:

```
cd d:\code\mediManagerApp
```

- Compile all Java sources:

```
javac *.java
```

- Run the application (the main class is `MediManagerApp`):

```
java MediStockApp
```

**Data file format (`pharmacy_db.txt`)**
- The application reads and writes inventory to `pharmacy_db.txt` in a simple text format. Keep a backup of this file before experimenting.

**Usage Notes**
- If you get `NoClassDefFoundError` or `Could not find or load main class`, verify you are in the correct directory and the `.class` files were generated by `javac`.
- To reset the inventory, stop the app and clear or replace `pharmacy_db.txt`.

**Contact**
- If you want help extending the project, tell me what you want (GUI, persistence improvements, tests) and I can implement it.
